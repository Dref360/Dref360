### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fred!

I'm an applied research scientist working primarily on Bayesian active learning, uncertainty estimation, and explainability. I want to make AI works for everyone and I believe that it starts with better practices around dataset creation and model inference. 

I'm slowly learning frontend development with React ðŸš€ and I have strong skills as a backend developer (FastAPI, Dask, HuggingFace, Pytorch).

#### Opensource

I'm a strong believer in opensource, I was chairman at Keras before co-founding [BaaL](https://github.com/ElementAI/baal), an active learning library. Recently, I worked on opensourcing [Azimuth](https://github.com/ServiceNow/azimuth), an error analysis tool for text classification.

I'm looking for new projects to contribute to, please contact me if you need some help!
I am learning more about the HuggingFace ðŸ¤— and Pytorch Lightning ecosystems which I find fantastic! 

Ask me about anything related to (fair) deep learning and open-source!
